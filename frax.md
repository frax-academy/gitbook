# FRAX

FRAX is a USD stablecoin that is issued by Frax Protocol via smart contracts.

It is designed to be the ideal stablecoin for DeFi with the following properties:

* FRAX cannot be censored, meaning that itâ€™s impossible to block anyone from sending or receiving FRAX tokens.
* FRAX is fully transparent with all its assets, including the collateral, visible on the blockchain.
* FRAX is reliable as it is largely backed by stable assets, opposed to uncollateralised stablecoins.
* FRAX is scalable and capital efficient as the cost to mint FRAX is lower than for stablecoins that are over-collateralized.
