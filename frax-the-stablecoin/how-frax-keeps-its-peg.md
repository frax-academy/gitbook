# How FRAX keeps its peg

Frax Finance ensures that FRAX is always worth one US Dollar with multiple instruments.&#x20;

The first one is the protocol’s Mint and Redeem function, where 1 FRAX can be minted or redeemed for 1 dollar worth of USDC and FXS (Frax Shares Token).

The second instrument is Frax’s gauge system where users are incentivised to lock liquidity pool tokens. This ensures that vast amounts of stablecoins like USDC and DAI can be traded against FRAX.&#x20;

Frax furthermore incentivises users to add liquidity for FRAX pools on Curve, this is often referred to as “the bribe wars”.&#x20;

Another unique instrument created by Frax are its AMOs (Autonomous Market Operations) which are smart contracts that can mint or burn FRAX tokens into stablecoin pools to balance these pools and through it the price of FRAX.
