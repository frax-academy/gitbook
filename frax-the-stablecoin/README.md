# FRAX the stablecoin

FRAX is a USD stablecoin that is issued by Frax Finance via smart contracts.

It is designed to be the ideal stablecoin for DeFi with the following properties:

* FRAX cannot be censored, meaning that itâ€™s impossible to block anyone from sending or receiving FRAX tokens.
* FRAX is fully transparent with all its assets, including the collateral, visible on the blockchain. No funny business.
* FRAX is reliable as it is largely backed by stable assets, opposed to uncollateralised stablecoins.
* FRAX is scalable and can quickly expand to meet the demand of DeFi.
* FRAX is capital efficient making it relavitely cheap to borrow FRAX on lending platforms.
