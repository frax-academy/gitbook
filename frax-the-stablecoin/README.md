# FRAX the stablecoin

FRAX is a US Dollar stablecoin that is issued by Frax Finance via smart contracts.

It is designed to be the ideal stablecoin for DeFi with FRAX being:

* **Uncensorable**, meaning itâ€™s impossible to block anyone from sending or receiving FRAX tokens.
* **Transparent** with all Frax's assets, including the collateral, visible on the blockchain. No funny business.
* **Reliable** as it is largely backed by stable assets, opposed to uncollateralised stablecoins.
* **Capital efficient**, so it can expand quickly to meet the demand of DeFi, and offer low borrow rates compared to overcollateralized stablecoins.
