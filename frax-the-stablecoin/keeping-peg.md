# Keeping peg

Frax Finance ensures that FRAX trades at 1 USD with multiple instruments.&#x20;

The first one is the protocol’s Mint and Redeem functions. These functions allow anyone to profit from the price difference between the value of FRAX on the open market and 1 USD, because FRAX can alsways be traded with the protocol for 1 USD. For more details see \[link to Mint/Redeem]

The second instrument is the staking system where users are incentivised to lock FRAX against other stablecoins. This ensures that vast amounts of stablecoins like USDC and DAI can be traded against FRAX. More stablecoin-to-stablecoin liquidity means that more FRAX can be bought or sold before its price is affected.&#x20;

Frax also incentivises users to add liquidity to FRAX pools on Curve, this is often referred to as “the bribe wars”. These incentives lead to more liquidity, which similar to the staking system, leads to more price stability.

Another unique instrument created by Frax are its AMOs (Autonomous Market Operations) which are smart contracts that can mint or burn FRAX tokens into stablecoin pools to balance these pools and through it the price of FRAX. Through the use of these AMOs, the Frax protocol itself owns so much liquidity that is has become mathematically impossible for FRAX to de-peg.
