# FRAX's price

Since the launch of the protocol in December 2020, FRAX has never been off-peg. Off-peg means that the price averaged accross all markets deviates more than 1 cent from a dollar. The stability of FRAX is easy to observe from the price chart shown on [Frax Finance](https://app.frax.finance/). The fact that FRAX always kept its peg, even during the most volatile times, can be verified by checking every trade on the blockchain. It is truly a testiment to the reliability of FRAX.&#x20;

An easy and reliable way to check the current price of FRAX is through [Chainlink’s FRAX price feed](https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/stablecoins/frax-usd). Price sources like coingecko and coinmarketcap aren’t always reporting the correct price. Price errors on these platforms typically occur during volatile periods, exactly when people are watching prices closely. So don’t fall for FRAX price FUD on social channels, but check the price from a reliable source like [Chainlink](https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/stablecoins/frax-usd), [Curve](https://curve.fi/), [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?chain=mainnet), or [1inch](https://app.1inch.io/#/1/swap/FRAX/USDC).
