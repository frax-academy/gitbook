# Collateral Ratio

Unique to FRAX is that it has a dynamic collateral ratio (CR) which has been adjusting based on market demand since its inception. This means that the amount of collateral per FRAX token is not fixed, say 1:1 (100%) or 1:2 (50%) but determined by an algorithm. This algorithm lowers the collateral ratio when the demand for FRAX is high, and increases the ratio when the demand for FRAX is low (see the [official documentation](https://docs.frax.finance/price-stability#pidcontroller-update) for details). Historically the Collateral Ratio for FRAX has moved between 80 and 100% as can be seen in the dashboard on [Frax Finance](https://app.frax.finance/). Being fractionally collateralized is what gave Frax its name.
