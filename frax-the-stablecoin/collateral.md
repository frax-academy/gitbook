# Collateral

Collateral are the assets backing a financial agreement that guarantee that it has a value. The purpose of collateral is to cement trust between the holder and the asset so the holder does not have to worry about the asset losing its value. There are several examples of collateral being used in DeFi including for loans and in the case of FRAX, a stablecoin.

At launch, FRAX's collateral consisted of USDC tokens sitting idle in a smart contract. With the introduction of Algorithmic Market Operations (AMOs), Frax has diversified its collateral. This diverse range of collateral of FRAX can be seen in the "Frax Distribution" diagram on [Frax Finance](https://app.frax.finance/). It currently consist of stablecoin tokens in FRAX pools on Curve Finance (Curve AMOs), stablecoin tokens in various other pools and protocols (Liquidity AMOs), non-stablecoin tokens (Investor AMO), claims on FRAX supplied to lending protocols (Lending AMOs), and USDC tokens (USDC pool). All this collateral sits on the blockchain and is directly owned by the protocol.&#x20;



_Note that while the Frax Shares token (FXS) is used by the protocol to back the price of FRAX, it is not counted as collateral (see_ [mint-and-redeem.md](mint-and-redeem.md "mention") _for more info)._
